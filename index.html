           <h3>WHAT IS WASTE & CO?</h3>
            <p>
                <br>

                
Wate & Co is an app designed for Victoria Uni students to help them
live a more sustainable life through food waste. Every year 130,000 tonnes
of food waste to the landfil. Itâ€™s not only costing kiwis money but is 
also bad for the enviroment. 

This app is needed because even though this infromation is already out 
there, an app has not not been developed specifically for Vic students.
By creating an app developed and designed by Vic students, it is
therefore more relatable and educational for the intended target audience.             </p>

                    <br>
            <p>
The app uses information from the Victoria University Sustainable Organisation. Retrieving information about sustainable news at Victoria University as well as updating frequently with new information, videos and tips. The forum is an interactive tool that students are able to use and interact with other students through. By using this tool, students are able to gain information from students that are in similar living and financial situation to themselves. This information will be stored through the firebase database.            </div>
